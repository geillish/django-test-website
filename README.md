# Django Website For Testing

This is just a simple Django website I've been messing around with for testing and getting used to the framework.

## What I've Been Doing

This site is just being used to set up different users in the Django admin page, where the users can have their own profile with their interests, etc.

It's just being used so I can get used to the different functionalities of Django and in the future, so I can make more complex projects and use this as a place to test and break things I would like to try out.
